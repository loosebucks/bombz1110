                    <br>

                    <p>Simpl3r: Bounty Hunters is a project with a 8k supply that came out in mid September and had a mint price of 2 SOL (SOL was 33$).<br>
<br>
                        What Is Simpl3r: Bounty Hunters<br>
                        Simpl3r: Bounty Hunters is a utility based project.<br>
                        The main driver behind the project is the utility.<br>
                        <br>
                        Utility<br>
                        The utility can be separated into 2 categories: Simpl3r and Protection.<br>
                        - Simpl3r<br>
                        Simpl3r is a community management platform designed for Web3 teams and helps projects with analyzing crucial data related to: sales, marketing, WL, socials and community.<br>
                        Some examples of the utility:<br>
                        Sales Hub - provides industry-first insights into customer buying habits.<br> 
                        Marketing Hub - helps you easily manage your marketing and create viral community engagement.<br> 
                        Engagement Hub - allows teams to get detailed information about the levels of engagement they are getting across platforms such as Discord and Twitter.<br>
                        Commit Now, Pay Later - allows teams to enable and incentivize collectors to commit to a mint ahead of time.<br>
                        NOTE - there are more sub-utilities in all of the listed sections, I have only stated to most basic explanation (more info in WP).<br> 
                        - Protection<br>
                        V3rify - an advanced holder verification system designed to deliver seamless onboarding of community members.<br>
                        Prot3ct - a protocol that automatically deactivates any NFT in your collection that has not been bought with royalties included, by either removing your IP and swapping the image with a warning or by placing an overlay over the original image warning the purchaser to pay the full royalties or the NFT will be deactivated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Overview<br>
                        There is a lot more info regarding staking, NFT customization and a WL marketplace but in the interest of keeping this as short as possible if you want more info go check out their WP (its a long read but worth it).<br>
                        The amount of utility and building this projects contains makes me excited to see what else they can bring to the table.<br>
                        Giving out early BSL vibes for sure.<br>
                        <br>

                            <br>
                            Utility<br>
                            The native token is called $INK (no LP atm) and can be earned by staking.<br>
                            Staking has two forms: Shop staking and Drink the Ink.<br>
                            Shop staking is a normal version of vanilla staking while Drink the Ink is a gamefied version where you can lvl up your MTC and earn more $INK.<br>
                            $INK can/will be used in a couple of ways like:<br>
                            - IRL tattoos - use $INK to pay for IRL tattoos <br>
                            - Virtual tattoos - use $INK to get your avatar tattooed, first tattoo shop in the Sandbox<br>
                            - Ink vial - use $INK to purchase an Ink Vial, lvl up your Ink Vial to lvl 5 in order to upgrade your NFT and earn more $INK daily while staking.<br>
                            - Merch and giveaways<br>
                            <br>
